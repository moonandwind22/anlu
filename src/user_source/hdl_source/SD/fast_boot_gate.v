// R3'-A2: fast boot - first image ready starts the player while remaining
// images continue loading in the background. Cuts perceived boot from ~4 s
// (all four images) to ~1 s (one image). The ingest chain already tracks
// per-image completion via image_complete; this module just re-gates the
// player enable on "at least one image done" instead of "all images done",
// and gates image switching on the target image's own completion.
//
// Switch safety: media_player_control receives a switch request only when
// the target image is loaded (image_complete[target]). The existing
// black-dwell protocol handles the SDRAM side. If a switch to an unloaded
// image is requested (shouldn't happen in normal flow, but defensive),
// the gate holds the request until that image finishes loading.
